# How to Create a Play

Welcome developers! We are as excited as you are to know that you are going to create a new play. It is super easy to get started.

> **Note:** The steps below assumes that you have forked and cloned the [react-play](https://github.com/reactplay/react-play) repository. Also, you have installed the dependencies using the `npm install` or `yarn install` command. If you are new to forking, please watch this [YouTube Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8suY-Osn8Q) to get started.

- Run the application using

  ```bash
  yarn start

  or

  npm run start
  ```

  If you face dependency issues, then try running this command:

  ```bash
  npm install --legacy-peer-deps
  ```

  You might check the [README](https://github.com/reactplay/react-play#readme) file for more details.

- You should be able to access the application on http://localhost:3000
- Click on `Create` button.
